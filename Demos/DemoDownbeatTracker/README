This demo was used in the first semester to illustrate how the beat and downbeat tracker works. The feature files, beat tracker and downbeat tracker files here might NOT be up to date. Only the files in the Application/ directory are correct, but not included here because they might not be compactible.

Consider this code as an example of a useful demo, but might need some adaptations to be completely reflect the latest changes.
